The '''cerebral cortex''' is a sheet of neural tissue that is outermost to the cerebrum of the mammalian brain. It plays a key role in memory, attention, perceptual awareness, thought, language, and consciousness. It is constituted of up to six horizontal layers, each of which has a different composition in terms of neurons and connectivity.

One of the 10 basic divisions of the cerebrospinal axi. The cerebral cortex is the dorsal topographic division of the endbrain (Kuhlenbeck, 1927), with a basically radial, laminated architecture.

:Category:Prefrontal cortex,,Prefrontal cortex,nlx_anat_090801,"The anterior part of the frontal lobes of the brain, lying in front of the motor and premotor areas.

This brain region has been implicated in planning complex cognitive behaviors, personality expression, decision making and moderating correct social behavior. The basic activity of this brain region is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals.

The most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the pre-frontal cortex area is executive function. Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social ""control"" (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially-unacceptable outcomes).

There are clear subtypes within this cytoarchitectural subregion, notably including the ""granular aggregate"" type of cytoarchitecture characteristic of the paw, limb, and mystacial vibrissae areas, and the ""barrel-field"" type (originally described by Woolsey and Van der Loos, '70) seen in the nose and perioral regions.

In most adult mammals, the SVZ is a three-layered sheath that lies along the lateral wall of the lateral ventricle and consists of type A, B, and C cells. Type A rest along the ventricle wall and are neuronal precursor cells, Type B are adjacent astrocytes, and Type C are immature precursors to the Type A neuroblasts. The neuronal precursor cells travel along the rostral migratory stream ensheathed in a tube of Type B astrocytes, until they reach the olfactory bulb. There they integrate into the existing cellular network and mature into local interneurons. While the majority become adult-born granule cells, a subset become periglomerular cells.

Interestingly, the human SVZ differs from other mammals' in several ways. It consists of four layers rather than three: ependymal cells (layer I), a hypo cellular gap (layer II), a ribbon of astrocytes (layer III), and a transitional zone (layer IV). The astrocytes are capable of differentiating into many kinds of tissue including new neurons. However, there is no evidence that the proliferating neurons travel along the rostral migratory stream in a chain to populate the olfactory bulb with new interneurons, as is the case for other mammals.",,,subependymal zone,,,:Category:Telencephalon,:Category:Adult neurogenesis,":Category:Olfactory bulb (main) periglomerular cell,:Category:Olfactory bulb (main) adult-born granule cell,:Category:Olfactory bulb,:Category:Rostral migratory stream",:Category:Regional part of brain,Regional part of brain

As a more technical definition, the telencephalon refers to the cerebral hemispheres and other, smaller structures within the brain, although the telencephalon is one of the larger divisions (in terms of number). It is the anterior-most embryological division of the brain that develops from the prosencephalon. The telencephalon is composed of the following sub-regions; Limbic system; Cerebral cortex or cortices of the cerebral hemispheres, Basal ganglia, Olfactory bulb.  The telencephalon comprises what most people think of as the ""brain."" It lies on top of the brainstem and is the largest and most well-developed of the five major divisions of the brain. The telencephalon is the newest structure in the phylogenetic sense, with mammals having the largest and most well-developed among all species. It emerges from the prosencephalon, the first of three vesicles that form from the embryonic neural tube (Christine Fennema-Notestine).",,,,,,:Category:Forebrain,:Category:PONS reference structure,,:Category:Regional part of brain,Regional part of brain

Furthermore, VTA projects to brain stem targets of the MTN (Giolli et al, J Comp Neurol, 1985).

It initially took a while to get comfortable with NIF interface, but once I got used to it, I discovered that it is a very powerful website that exclusively narrows the search results to neuroscience.
