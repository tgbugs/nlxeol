It was separated from C57BL/6J in 1951. 5 SNP differences have been identified that distinguish C57BL/6J from C57BL/6ByJ and C57BL/6NJ. Both C57BL/6ByJ and C57BL/6NJ type as follows: 08-015199792-M is C; 11-004367508-M is A; 13-041017317-M is C; 15-057561875-M is G; 19-049914266-M is T. C57BL/6J types as follows: 08-015199792-M is T; 11-004367508-M is G; 13-041017317-M is T; 15-057561875-M is A; 19-049914266-M is G (Petkov and Wiles, 2005.)  Strain Development In 1951 C57BL/6J, then at generation F32, were sent from The Jackson Laboratory to The National Institute of Health where they were maintained via sibling mating for decades. In 1980 this subline reached F126 and in 1984 embryos were cryopreserved at the NIH cryopreservation facility. In approximately 1994 some of these embryos were thawed and maintained via sibling mating and this subline was referred to as B6(e84) to specify that it derived from the embryos frozen in 1984. In September and October of 1997 a new set of embryos were cryopreserved from this thawed line by backcrossing +F6 females to their +F5 fathers. In 2005 some of these embryos frozen in 1997 were sent to The Jackson Laboratory where they were thawed and gave rise to C57BL/6NJ. Thus, C57BL/6NJ is devoid of mutations that may have arisen in any C57BL/6N sublines that remained on the shelf after the 1984 freeze. The embryos received by The Jackson Laboratory were thawed, the colony expanded, and re-frozen immediately. This strain is maintained with frequent replenishment from this frozen stock in order to arrest genetic drift.",,,,,

Mice homozygous for this SMNF7 floxed allele are viable and fertile and do not display any gross physical or behavioral abnormalities. Mutant mice exhibit no transcript splicing defects. Cre-mediated recombination of the loxP-flanked sequences results in deletion of exon 7 of the targeted gene. As mutations of this exon are implicated in 95% of all human spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), these mice may be useful in studying SMA or other neuromuscular degenerative diseases.

When crossed to a strain expressing Cre recombinase in neurons (see Stock No. 005938, Stock No. 006297, and Stock No. 006663), this mutant mouse strain may be useful as a model of SMA.

When crossed to a strain expressing Cre recombinase in striated muscle fibers (see Stock No. 005936, Stock No. 006139, and Stock No. 006149), this mutant mouse strain may be useful as a model of SMA.

SMNF7 mice are available on different genetic backgrounds (see Stock No. 006138 and Stock No. 006146). In an attempt to offer alleles on well-characterized or multiple genetic backgrounds, alleles are frequently moved to a genetic background different from that on which an allele was first characterized. It should be noted that the SMNF7 phenotype could vary from that originally described on a mixed genetic background. We will modify the strain description if necessary as published results become available.

Importation of this model was supported by the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation. Creation and development was supported by the National Institute of Health and Medical Research of France (Inserm) and the Association Française contre les Myopathies (AFM). An additional help was provided by Families of SMA (U.S.A.) and Andrew?s Buddies (U.S.A.).

Development
A targeting vector was used to insert a neomycin resistance gene within intron 6 and place loxP sites immediately flanking exon 7 of the endogenous gene. This construct was electroporated into ""129Sv"" embryonic stem (ES) cells. Correctly targeted cells were injected into blastocysts. The resulting chimeric males were bred to C57BL/6J females. Heterozygous offspring were bred to generate homozygous mice. Homozygotes on this mixed B6;129 background were bred together for approximately 5 years before arrival at The Jackson Laboratory. After arriving, mutant mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J inbred mice (Stock No. 000664) for 5-10 generations. After this, heterozygotes were bred together to generate this homozygous congenic colony.

The expression of the mutant human MAPT is five-fold higher than the expression of the endogenous mouse MAPT protein. Hyperphosphorylated, insoluble mutant human MAPT protein in the brain accumulates with age causing decreased microtubule binding. At three months of age, transgenic mice exhibit clasping and limb retraction when lifted by the tail, which progresses to limb weakness. By 10 months of age the mice exhibit a hunched back and paralysis, followed by inability to feed. Transgenic mice have a median lifespan of approximately nine months with approximately 80% dying by 12 months. Histological analysis reveals neuron degeneration in hippocampus and ventricular dilatation (brain atrophy) by eight months of age, although significant neuron degeneration in the hippocampus occurs at approximately nine months of age. Neuron loss spreads to the amygdala, neocortex and entorhinal cortex by 12 months of age. Defective translocation of endoplasmic reticulum proteins in affected neurons is observed as early as three months of age. The onset of neurofibrillay tangle formation in the neocortex, amygdala, hippocampus, brain stem and spinal cord is five months of age. Transgenic mice display neuroinflammation with microglial activation and astrogliosis. The ultrastructure of the neurofibrillay tangle-like lesions detected is similar to that found in brain lesions of human Alzheimer's disease and tauopathy patients. Degradation of synaptic function is significant by six months of age. These mice cannot be bred to homozygosity, homozygous females do not mate. This mutant mouse strain may be useful in studies of neurodegenerative tauopathy and Alzheimer's disease.",,,,,

These transgenic mice express human A53T variant alpha-synuclein (full-length, 140 amino acid isoform) under the direction of the mouse prion protein promoter. At eight months of age, some homozygous mice develop a progressively severe motor phenotype. Presentation of the phenotype may manifest at 14-15 months of age (on average). Lax grooming, weight loss and diminished mobility precede movement impairment, partial limb paralysis, trembling and inability to stand. Immunohistochemistry analysis of mutants between eight to 12 months of age reveals widely distributed alpha-synuclein inclusions, with dense accumulation in the spinal cord, brainstem, cerebellum and thalamus. The appearance of alpha-synuclein aggregate inclusions parallels the onset of the motor impairment phenotype. Axons and myelin sheaths exhibit progressive ultrastructural degeneration. Immunoelectron microscopy and biochemical analysis show the inclusions in neurons are comprised primarily of 10-16 nm fibrils of alpha-synuclein. The structure, location and onset of the inclusions seen in the mutant mice resemble characteristics seen in human neuronal alpha-synucleinopathies, such as familial Parkinson's Disease. Mice hemizygous for the transgenic insert develop similar phenotypic traits, but onset occurs later, between 22 and 28 months of age. Homozygous mice have a high incidence of nonproductive matings.

Development
The transgene is about 1 kb of the human HD gene and includes the promoter region, exon 1 with 120 +/- 5 CAG repeats. This strain was identified as the R6-2 line in the original publication.

In fall 2006, the B6CBA-Tg(HDexon1)62Gpb/1J colony was shown to have a reduction in the number of CAG repeat units in the transgene (approximately 100-105 CAG repeats), and to exhibit a concomitant decrease in severity and delayed onset in the expected neurological phenotype. The Repository recovered frozen embryos from the HDexon1 line during the winter of 2006/7. The cryo-recovered line has approximately 160 +/- 10 CAG repeats, and onset of HD symptoms occurs between 9 and 11 weeks of age, as originally reported for this strain.

The cryo-recovered line will be named B6CBA-Tg(HDexon1)62Gpb/1J (Stock No. 002810). The line formerly distributed as Stock No. 002810 will be named B6CBA-Tg(HDexon1)62Gpb/3J (Stock No. 006494).",,,,,

Many homozygous mutant mice die at weaning age, but some survive to adulthood, and females may breed. The cerebellum in homozygous mutants is very small, simple, and almost devoid of granule cells, which degenerate during the second week. Heterozygotes behave normally, but they have a smaller than normal cerebellum with a deficiency of granule cells, some of which fail to migrate into the internal granule layer and remain scattered in the molecular layer. Evidence from cultures of mutant and normal cerebellum show that granule cells of wv/wv and wv/+ mice have gene-dosage dependent abnormalities in morphology and cell behavior. Studies using homozygous weaver/wildtype chimeras indicate that the migration defect of granule cells is intrinsic to the granule cells themselves. The disarrangement of Purkinje cells, however, is not caused by intrinsic action of weaver in these cells. Cell mixing experiments also suggest Kcnj6wv acts non-autonomously and encodes a membrane-associated ligand that induces external germinal layer neuron differentiation.  Strain Development Weaver (Kcnj6wv) arose spontaneously in the pedigreed expansion stocks of C57BL/6J at The Jackson Laboratory in 1961. It was maintained by mating tested pairs until F21.

A strain of laboratory mouse. It is probably the most widely used of all inbred strains, (substrain C57BL/6 alone accounts for over 14% of occasions on which an inbred strain is used) though in many ways it seems to be atypical of inbred strains of laboratory mice. In contrast to 36 other standard inbred strains, it carries a Y chromosome of Asian Mus musculus origin (c.f. AKR and SWR) (Tucker et al 1992), and a LINE-1 element derived from Mus spretus the frequency of which suggests that up to 6.5% of the genome may be of M. spretus origin (Rikke et al, 1995). The phenotypic and genotypic similarity between any two related strains depends on the extent to which the parental colony was inbred at the time the strains were separated, and whether other strains contributed to the parentage of either strain. For example, C57BL/6 and C57BL/10 were separated in 1921, at a time when the parental C57BL colony was substantially inbred, and no other strains are known to have contributed to the parentage of either strain.

It was separated from C57BL/6J in 1951. 5 SNP differences have been identified that distinguish C57BL/6J from C57BL/6ByJ and C57BL/6NJ. Both C57BL/6ByJ and C57BL/6NJ type as follows: 08-015199792-M is C; 11-004367508-M is A; 13-041017317-M is C; 15-057561875-M is G; 19-049914266-M is T. C57BL/6J types as follows: 08-015199792-M is T; 11-004367508-M is G; 13-041017317-M is T; 15-057561875-M is A; 19-049914266-M is G (Petkov and Wiles, 2005.)  Strain Development In 1951 C57BL/6J, then at generation F32, were sent from The Jackson Laboratory to The National Institute of Health where they were maintained via sibling mating for decades. In 1980 this subline reached F126 and in 1984 embryos were cryopreserved at the NIH cryopreservation facility. In approximately 1994 some of these embryos were thawed and maintained via sibling mating and this subline was referred to as B6(e84) to specify that it derived from the embryos frozen in 1984. In September and October of 1997 a new set of embryos were cryopreserved from this thawed line by backcrossing +F6 females to their +F5 fathers. In 2005 some of these embryos frozen in 1997 were sent to The Jackson Laboratory where they were thawed and gave rise to C57BL/6NJ. Thus, C57BL/6NJ is devoid of mutations that may have arisen in any C57BL/6N sublines that remained on the shelf after the 1984 freeze. The embryos received by The Jackson Laboratory were thawed, the colony expanded, and re-frozen immediately. This strain is maintained with frequent replenishment from this frozen stock in order to arrest genetic drift.",,,,,

Human huntingtin mRNA and protein is detected. Hyperkinesis begins at 3 months of age with progressive motor impairment appearing at 6 months of age. This is followed by progressive neurodegeneration, starting at 9 months of age, and hypokinesis at 12 months. The motor dysfunction, Rotorod deficit, is correlated with neuronal loss. Mutants exhibit decreased brain weight and reduced striatal and cortical volumes. 18% shrinkage of striatal neurons is observed in 12 month old mutants. A significant decrease (15%) in the number of striatal neurons occurs by 12 months of age. Nuclear huntingtin aggregate inclusions of striatal neurons from 18 month old mutant mice are detected at the light microscopy level. This mutant mouse strain represents a model that may be useful in studies of Huntington's disease.

Development
A YAC containing a full-length human huntingtin gene was modified with a 128 CAG repeat expansion in exon 1. The resulting construct (YAC128) was injected into FVB/N pronuclei.",,,,,

:Category:FVB/NJ,,,birnlex_499,,,,,"A substrain of the FVB inbred laboratory mouse. From Jackson Laboratories: FVB/NJ was inbred for the fv1b allele which confers sensitivity to the Friend leukaemia virus B strain. Due to the prominent pronuclei in their fertilized eggs and the large litter size, FVB/NJ are commonly used for transgenic injection. Relative to many other inbred strains, FVB/NJ is highly susceptible to asthma-like airway responsiveness with significant generation of antigen-specific IgE?. Despite having the H2q MHC haplotype, FVB/NJ are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis...Strain development: In 1966, outbred Swiss mice at the National Institues of Health were selectively bred for either resistance or sensitivity to histamine challenge post pertussis vaccination. At the eighth generation of inbreeding (in the early 1970s), the sensitive line, HSFS/N, was found to carry the Fv1b allele which confers sensitivity to the Friend leukaemia virus B strain. The FVB/N strain resulted from inbreeding this line for the fv1b allele. In 1988 FVB/N mice were imported from NIH to Dr. Taketo at The Jackson Laboratory and in 1991 these were re-derived at F50 into the foundation stocks facility at The Jackson Laboratory. In December 2002 this strain reached F87.

NJ,NJ,,birnlex_499,,,FVB,,"A substrain of the FVB inbred laboratory mouse. From Jackson Laboratories: FVB/NJ was inbred for the fv1b allele which confers sensitivity to the Friend leukaemia virus B strain. Due to the prominent pronuclei in their fertilized eggs and the large litter size, FVB/NJ are commonly used for transgenic injection. Relative to many other inbred strains, FVB/NJ is highly susceptible to asthma-like airway responsiveness with significant generation of antigen-specific IgE?. Despite having the H2q MHC haplotype, FVB/NJ are resistant to collagen-induced arthritis...Strain development: In 1966, outbred Swiss mice at the National Institues of Health were selectively bred for either resistance or sensitivity to histamine challenge post pertussis vaccination. At the eighth generation of inbreeding (in the early 1970s), the sensitive line, HSFS/N, was found to carry the Fv1b allele which confers sensitivity to the Friend leukaemia virus B strain. The FVB/N strain resulted from inbreeding this line for the fv1b allele. In 1988 FVB/N mice were imported from NIH to Dr. Taketo at The Jackson Laboratory and in 1991 these were re-derived at F50 into the foundation stocks facility at The Jackson Laboratory. In December 2002 this strain reached F87.  From the JAX catalog: Type: Inbred Strain Type: JAX  GEMM  Strain - Spontaneous Mutation TJL Mating System: Sibling x Sibling (Female x Male) Species: laboratory mouse H2 Haplotype: q Generation: F96 (14-DEC-06) Appearance: albino Related Genotype: A/A Tyrc/Tyrc",,,,,
