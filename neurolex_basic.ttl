The restriction of the piriform cell somata to the boundary between the zone of horizontal cells and the zone of vertical cells is remarkably accurate and consistent. The piriform cells give rise to 2 to 5 dendrites from the superficial surface, which course through the zone of horizontal cells to terminate just beneath the surface. As the ascending dendrites approach the surface they branch more frequently, almost always by equipartition, to form a complicated intermingling bouquet of slowly tapering dendrites, 150 to 350 micrometers in width and slightly less than 200 micrometers in depth. The axon most frequently takes its origin from the base of the soma, but sometimes it arises from one of the low order dendrites. From its origin the axon runs immediately down through the zone of vertical cells, occasionally with collaterals which may arborize within the superficial laminae.

The dendritic field is narrow and cylindrical, 100 to 250 micrometer in diameter, and extends from the upper margin of the zone of horizontal cells to the lower margin of the zone of vertical cells, about 500 micrometers. Rather than having superficial and deep fields, the pyramidal cell has the deep field reduced to a circumsomatic field, or a diminuitive basal field, and the superficial field is relatively elongated to accord with the deeper cell body. Pyramidal cells are usually multipolar, with one or two thick apical dendrites, which branch several times on the way to the surface, particularly in the upper portion of the zone of horizontal cells, and several smaller dendrites which form a small field about the cell body. It is of interest that smooth pyramidal cells tend to have two primary dendrites, like smooth vertical fusiform cells.

Cajal called these triangular or stellate cells. Cajal's nomenclature is rather bulky and, though descriptive, somewhat confusing because stellate cells are a distinct cell type in the nomenclature of this paper and triangular occurs in both names. For reasons developed below, the ovoid or triangular cells or wide field cells of the zone of vertical cells will be called Type II ganglion cells and the triangular or stellate cells or wide field cells of the zone of optic fibers will be called Type III ganglion cells. Type I ganglion cells are the piriform cells. Collator note: we assumed this class of neurons as projection neurons, because at least several subpopulations project to visually related areas.

They differ in that some of their dendrites extend below the cell body and their cell bodies lie in the zone of optic fibers. The axon almost invariably runs down into the deep portion of the colliculus. Type III ganglion cells tend to have fewer, but thicker, dendrites passing through the first two zones than is usual for Type II ganglion cells.

Stellate cells are multipolar with dendrites arising from any portion of the cell body. The dendrites may range anywhere from gnarled to radiate with the gnarled spiny cells most frequent in the zone of horizontal cells and the smooth radiate cells increasingly more frequent in the deeper zones until they are almost the only cell type in the zones below the stratum opticum. The dimensions of the cell bodies and dendritic fields are comparable to those of other cells in the same zone and the dendritic field is generally contained within the same zone as the cell body. The axons of stellate cells have both local and/or distant distributions and a morphology characteristic of intrinsic axons.

It has CNS side effects and hepatototoxic potential. (From Smith and Reynard, Textbook of Pharmacology, 1992, p919) Pharmacology: Thiabendazole is a fungicide and parasiticide. Thiabendazole is also a chelating agent, which means that it is used medicinally to bind metals in cases of metal poisoning, such as lead poisoning, mercury poisoning or antimony poisoning. Thiabendazole is vermicidal and/or vermifugal against Ascaris lumbricoides (\"common roundworm\"), Strongyloides stercoralis (threadworm), Necator americanus, Ancylostoma duodenale (hookworm), Trichuris trichiura (whipworm), Ancylostoma braziliense (dog and cat hookworm), Toxocara canis, Toxocara cati (ascarids), and Enterobius vermicularis (pinworm). Thiabendazole also suppresses egg and/or larval production and may inhibit the subsequent development of those eggs or larvae which are passed in the feces. Mechanism of action: The precise mode of action of thiabendazole on the parasite is unknown, but it most likely inhibits the helminth-specific enzyme fumarate reductase. Drug type: Approved.

    skos:definition "Eletriptan is a second generation triptan drug developed by Pfizer Inc for the treatment of migraine headaches. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Eletriptan is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine 1B/1D receptor agonist. In the anesthetized dog, eletriptan has been shown to reduce carotid arterial blood flow, with only a small increase in arterial blood pressure at high doses. While the effect on blood flow was selective for the carotid arterial bed, decreases in coronary artery diameter were observed. Eletriptan has also been shown to inhibit trigeminal nerve activity in the rat. Mechanism of action: Eletriptan binds with high affinity to 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D and 5-HT1F receptors, has modest affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT1E, 5-HT2B and 5-HT7 receptors, and little or no affinity for 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT5A and 5-HT6 receptors. Eletriptan has no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at adrenergic alpha1, alpha2, or beta; dopaminergic D1 or D2; muscarinic; or opioid receptors. Two theories have been proposed to explain the efficacy of 5-HT receptor agonists in migraine. One theory suggests that activation of 5-HT1 receptors located on intracranial blood vessels, including those on the arteriovenous anastomoses, leads to vasoconstriction, which is correlated with the relief of migraine headache. The other hypothesis suggests that activation of 5-HT1 receptors on sensory nerve endings in the trigeminal system results in the inhibition of pro-inflammatory neuropeptide release.

Specifically, what is lacking is the stoichiometric information and completeness ( closed-world) of participants required to model them as chemical processes. Nevertheless interaction data is extremely useful and can be captured in BioPAX using this class. Usage: This class should be used by default for representing molecular interactions, such as those defined by PSI-MI level 2.5. The participants in a molecular interaction should be listed in the PARTICIPANTS slot. Note that this is one of the few cases in which the PARTICPANT slot should be directly populated with instances (see comments on the PARTICPANTS property in the interaction class description). If all participants are known with exact stoichiometry, ComplexAssembly class should be used instead. Example: Two proteins observed to interact in a yeast-two-hybrid experiment where there is not enough experimental evidence to suggest that the proteins are forming a complex by themselves without any indirect involvement of other proteins. This is the case for most large-scale yeast two-hybrid screens. Taken from BioPAX" .

    skos:definition "is the formation of synapses. Although it occurs throughout a healthy person's lifespan, an explosion of synapse formation occurs during early brain development. Synaptogenesis is particularly important during an individual's \"critical period\" of life, during which there is a certain degree of neuronal pruning due to competition for neural growth factors by neurons and synapses. Processes that are not used, or inhibited during this critical period will fail to develop normally later on in life.  Currently, the neuromuscular junction is the most well-characterized synapse, however new techniques have allowed for the study of hippocampal and cerebellar synapses. - definition adapted from Wikipedia" .

    skos:definition "Vardenafil (Levitra) is an oral therapy for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. It is a selective inhibitor of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5). Penile erection is a hemodynamic process initiated by the relaxation of smooth muscle in the corpus cavernosum and its associated arterioles. During sexual stimulation, nitric oxide is released from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum. Nitric oxide activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase resulting in increased synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscle cells of the corpus cavernosum. The cGMP in turn triggers smooth muscle relaxation, allowing increased blood flow into the penis, resulting in erection. The tissue concentration of cGMP is regulated by both the rates of synthesis and degradation via phosphodiesterases (PDEs). The most abundant PDE in the human corpus cavernosum is the cGMPspecific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5); therefore, the inhibition of PDE5 enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Pharmacology: Vardenafil is used to treat male erectile dysfunction (impotence) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Part of the physiological process of erection involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum. This then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), leading to smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in increased inflow of blood and an erection. Vardenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This means that, with vardenafil on board, normal sexual stimulation leads to increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum which leads to better erections. Without sexual stimulation and no activation of the NO/cGMP system, vardenafil should not cause an erection. Mechanism of action: Vardenafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by vardenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Impotence Agents.

    rdfs:label "Neuroplasticity" ;
    skos:definition "is the changing of neurons and the organization of their networks and so their function by experience. This idea was first proposed in 1892 by Santiago Ramón y Cajal the proposer of the neuron doctrine though the idea was largely neglected for the next fifty years. The first person to use the term neural plasticity appears to have been the Polish neuroscientist Jerzy Konorski.The brain consists of nerve cells or neurons (and glial cells) which are interconnected, and learning may happen through changing of the strength of the connections between neurons, by adding or removing connections, or by adding new cells. \"Plasticity\" relates to learning by adding or removing connections, or adding cells. During the 20th century, the consensus was that lower brain and neocortical areas were immutable in structure after childhood, meaning learning only happens by changing of connection strength, whereas areas related to memory formation, such as the hippocampus and dentate gyrus, where new neurons continue to be produced into adulthood, were highly plastic. This belief is being challenged by new findings, suggesting all areas of the brain are plastic even after childhood. Hubel and Wiesel had demonstrated that ocular dominance columns in the lowest neocortical visual area, V1, were largely immutable after the critical period in development. Critical periods also were studied with respect to language; the resulting data suggested that sensory pathways were fixed after the critical period. However, studies determined that environmental changes could alter behavior and cognition by modifying connections between existing neurons and via neurogenesis in the hippocampus and other parts of the brain, including the cerebellum. - definition adapted from Wikipedia" .

    skos:definition "neural network describes a population of physically interconnected neurons or a group of disparate neurons whose inputs or signalling targets define a recognizable circuit. Communication between neurons often involves an electrochemical process. The interface through which they interact with surrounding neurons usually consists of several dendrites (input connections), which are connected via synapses to other neurons, and one axon (output connection). If the sum of the input signals surpasses a certain threshold, the neuron sends an action potential (AP) at the axon hillock and transmits this electrical signal along the axon.In contrast, a neuronal circuit is a functional entity of interconnected neurons that influence each other (similar to a control loop in cybernetics). - definition adapted from Wikipedia" .

    skos:definition "Tadalafil is an orally adminstered drug used to treat male erectile dysfunction (impotence). It is marketed worldwide under the brand name Cialis. It is a phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) inhibitor. Tadalafil's distinguishing pharmacologic feature is its longer half-life (17.5 hours) compared with Viagra and Levitra (4-5 hours). This longer half-life results in a longer duration of action and is, in part, responsible for the Cialis nickname of the \"weekend pill.\" This longer half-life also is the basis of current investigation for tadalafil's use in pulmonary arterial hypertension as a once-daily therapy. (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Tadalafil is used to treat male erectile dysfunction (impotence) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Part of the physiological process of erection involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum. This then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), leading to smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in increased inflow of blood and an erection. Tadalafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This means that, with tadalafil on board, normal sexual stimulation leads to increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum which leads to better erections. Without sexual stimulation and no activation of the NO/cGMP system, tadalafil should not cause an erection. Mechanism of action: Tadalafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by tadalafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors. Vasoconstrictor Agents" .

    skos:definition "A selective blocker of dopamine D2 receptors and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors that acts as an atypical antipsychotic agent. It has been shown to improve both positive and negative symptoms in the treatment of schizophrenia. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Risperidone is an atypical antipsychotic medication. It is most often used to treat delusional psychosis (including schizophrenia), but risperidone is also used to treat some forms of bipolar disorder and psychotic depression. It also has shown some success in treating symptoms of Asperger's Syndrome and autism. Risperidone is now the most commonly prescribed antipsychotic medication in the United States. Mechanism of action: Blockade of dopaminergic D2 receptors in the limbic system alleviates positive symptoms of schizophrenia such as hallucinations, delusions, and erratic behavior and speech. Blockade of serotonergic 5-HT2 receptors in the mesocortical tract, causes an excess of dopamine and an increase in dopamine transmission, resulting in an increase in dopamine transmission and an elimination of core negative symptoms. Dopamine receptors in the nigrostriatal pathway are not affected by risperidone and extrapyramidal effects are avoided. Like other 5-HT2 antagonists, risperidone also binds at alpha(1)-adrenergic receptors and, to a lesser extent, at histamine H1 and alpha(2)-adrenergic receptors. Drug type: Approved. Investigational.

It is a 10% component of the antibiotic complex, nebramycin, produced by the same species. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Tobramycin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic obtained from cultures of Streptomyces tenebrarius, is used in combination with other antibiotics to treat urinary tract infections, gynecologic infections, peritonitis, endocarditis, pneumonia, bacteremia and sepsis, respiratory infections including those associated with cystic fibrosis, osteomyelitis, and diabetic foot and other soft-tissue infections. It acts primarily by disrupting protein synthesis, leading to altered cell membrane permeability, progressive disruption of the cell envelope, and eventual cell death. Tobramycin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative organisms including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Mechanism of action: Tobramycin binds irreversibly to one of two aminoglycoside binding sites on the 30 S ribosomal subunit, inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Tobramycin may also destabilize bacterial memebrane by binding to 16 S 16 S r-RNA. An active transport mechanism for aminoglycoside uptake is necessary in the bacteria in order to attain a significant intracellular concentration of tobramycin. Drug type: Approved. Investigational.

    skos:definition "Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response. Dietary vitamin A is derived from a variety of carotenoids found in plants. It is enriched in the liver, egg yolks, and the fat component of dairy products. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Vitamin A is effective for the treatment of Vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A refers to a group of fat-soluble substances that are structurally related to and possess the biological activity of the parent substance of the group called all-trans retinol or retinol. Vitamin A plays vital roles in vision, epithelial differentiation, growth, reproduction, pattern formation during embryogenesis, bone development, hematopoiesis and brain development. It is also important for the maintenance of the proper functioning of the immune system. Mechanism of action: Vision:Vitamin A (all-trans retinol) is converted in the retina to the 11-cis-isomer of retinaldehyde or 11-cis-retinal. 11-cis-retinal functions in the retina in the transduction of light into the neural signals necessary for vision. 11-cis-retinal, while attached to opsin in rhodopsin is isomerized to all-trans-retinal by light. This is the event that triggers the nerve impulse to the brain which allows for the perception of light. All-trans-retinal is then released from opsin and reduced to all-trans-retinol. All-trans-retinol is isomerized to 11-cis-retinol in the dark, and then oxidized to 11-cis-retinal. 11-cis-retinal recombines with opsin to re-form rhodopsin. Night blindness or defective vision at low illumination results from a failure to re-synthesize 11-cis retinal rapidly. Epithelial differentiation: The role of Vitamin A in epithelial differentiation, as well as in other physiological processes, involves the binding of Vitamin A to two families of nuclear retinoid receptors (retinoic acid receptors, RARs; and retinoid-X receptors, RXRs). These receptors function as ligand-activated transcription factors that modulate gene transcription. When there is not enough Vitamin A to bind these receptors, natural cell differentiation and growth are interrupted. Drug type: Approved. Nutraceutical. Small Molecule.

Pharmacology: Rizatriptan is a selective 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtype agonist indicated for the acute treatment of migraine attacks with or without aura in adults. Rizatriptan is not intended for the prophylactic therapy of migraine or for use in the management of hemiplegic or basilar migraine. Rizatriptan is an agonist for a vascular 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor subtype (probably a member of the 5-HT1D family) having only a weak affinity for 5-HT1A, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT7 receptors and no significant affinity or pharmacological activity at 5-HT2, 5-HT3 or 5-HT4 receptor subtypes or at alpha1-, alpha2-, or beta-adrenergic, dopamine1,; dopamine2; muscarinic, or benzodiazepine receptors. This action in humans correlates with the relief of migraine headache. In addition to causing vasoconstriction, experimental data from animal studies show that Rizatriptan also activates 5-HT1 receptors on peripheral terminals of the trigeminal nerve innervating cranial blood vessels, which may also contribute to the antimigrainous effect of Rizatriptan in humans. Mechanism of action: Rizatriptan binds with high affinity to human 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors leading to cranial blood vessel constriction. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-inflammatory Agents. Anti-migraine Agents. Selective Serotonin Agonists. Serotonin Agonists. Vasoconstrictor Agents" .

    skos:definition "The Derived Data Working Group is focused on understanding, addressing and solving the known difficulties of sharing and combining data across multiple sites  after post-processing and/or data analysis.  This WG is working closely with researchers at UC Irvine, Columbia, Duke, MIT, MRN and INCF on these goals:-Develop provenance and derived data extraction scripts for common neuroimaging analysis software and pipelines-Extend tools and specifications for international community requirements-Create/curate an initial neuroimaging terminology and ontology for derived data and common neuroimaging concepts-Augment/improve derived data import and query functionality for multi-site derived data federationsNeuroimaging data often involves many aspects of image and signal processing on the raw data which takes considerable time and expertise.  Making such derived data available in a structured and well documented way is of interest to the international neuroimaging community.  The availability of large multi-site datasets such as the Function BIRN schizophrenia datasets and the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project data provides researchers with well-documented and structured raw data.  The addition of a similarly well-documented and structured form for derived data is the focus of this working group.  Although the Function BIRN had made strides in developing the XCEDE XML schema for the structured storage and interchange of neuroimaging derived data, being able to extract both the derived results and the provenance of what happened to the data during the analytical manipulations directly from the software and pipelines performing the computations is missing.  Without this piece, documenting derived data provenance and results becomes a burden on the researchers who are more interested in addressing scientific hypotheses than in documenting who the result was obtained for other users.To address the needs for providing derived data to the public community we have formed the derived data working group. This group brings together researchers with extensive experience with neuroimaging studies and specifically with large-scale data analysis and management using the more prevalent software packages in the field, e.g. SPM and FSL. This working group leverages the experience of the group both within BIRN and in communication with other researchers through the INCF to identify information needed for a provenance description to be useful. Face-to-face meetings to discuss needs and possible approaches were held in 2011 and 2012 at UC Irvine in January, at OHBM in June 2011, at the INCF Standards for Data Sharing task force meeting in September, and a fourth meeting in November at the annual meeting for the Society for Neuroscience.Once these details are established and there is consensus among the community, we will address the format for which this information will be stored. Initially we are focusing on XML schemas that integrate with the existing XCEDE XML schema (W3C Prov model) which describes neuroimaging data sets in general.  After identifying the needed pieces of information and their storage format we will both work with the developers of the software packages to integrate the provenance schemas into their distributions or where not possible, write scripts to extract the information. All products of the derived data group are open-source and freely available to the community through the BIRN public wiki and INCF GitHub repositories." .

It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in April 2007 for the treatment of bacterial skin infections such as impetigo. It is marketed as an ointment under the name brand Altabax. It works by inhibiting the bacterial 50S ribosomal unit by binding to the 23S RNA. This prevents peptide synthesis. Pharmacology: Retapamulin is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor belonging to a class of compounds called pleuromutilins. These compounds act by inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of bacterial 50S ribosome. Mechanism of action: Retapamulin is a bacterial protein synthesis inhibitor belonging to a class of compounds called pleuromutilins. These compounds act by inhibiting the initiation of protein synthesis at the level of bacterial 50S ribosome. This binding site involves ribosomal protein L3 and is in the region of the ribosomal P site and peptidyl transferase center. By virtue of binding to this site, pleuromutilins inhibit peptidyl transfer, block P-site interactions, and prevent the normal formation of active 50S ribosomal subunits. Drug type: Approved.

Roxithromycin binds to the subunit 50S of the bacterial ribosome, and thus inhibits the translocation of peptides. Roxithromycin has similar antimicrobial spectrum as erythromycin, but is more effective against certain gram-negative bacteria, particularly Legionella pneumophila. It can treat respiratory tract, urinary and soft tissue infections. Pharmacology: Roxithromycin is a semi-synthetic macrolide antibiotic. It is very similar in composition, chemical structure and mechanism of action to erythromycin, azithromycin, or clarithromycin. Roxithromycin has the following antibacterial spectrum in vitro: Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pneumococcus), Neisseria meningitides (Meningococcus), Listeria monocytogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Legionella pneumophila, Helicobacter (Campylobacter), Gardnerella vaginalis, Bordetella pertussis, Moraxella catarrhalis (Branhamella Catarrhalis), and Haemophilus ducreyi. Roxithromycin is highly concentrated in polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages, achieving intracellular concentrations greater than those outside the cell. Roxithromycin enhances the adhesive and chemotactic functions of these cells which in the presence of infection produce phagocytosis and bacterial lysis. Roxithromycin also possesses intracellular bactericidal activity. Mechanism of action: Roxithromycin prevents bacteria from growing, by interfering with their protein synthesis.

    skos:definition "Sevelamer is a phosphate binding drug used to prevent hyperphosphataemia in patients with chronic renal failure. When taken with meals, sevelamer binds to dietary phosphate and prevents its absorption. It is marketed by Genzyme under the trade name Renagel. Pharmacology: Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) retain phosphorus and can develop hyperphosphatemia. High serum phosphorus can precipitate serum calcium resulting in ectopic calcification. When the product of serum calcium and phosphorus concentrations (Ca x P) exceeds 55 mg2/dL2, there is an increased risk that ectopic calcification will occur. Hyperphosphatemia plays a role in the development of secondary hyperparathyroidism in renal insufficiency. An increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels is characteristic of patients with chronic renal failure. Increased levels of PTH can lead to osteitis fibrosa, a bone disease. A decrease in serum phosphorus may decrease serum PTH levels. Treatment of hyperphosphatemia includes reduction in dietary intake of phosphate, inhibition of intestinal phosphate absorption with phosphate binders, and removal of phosphate with dialysis. Sevelamer taken with meals has been shown to decrease serum phosphorus concentrations in patients with ESRD who are on hemodialysis. In vitro studies have shown that the capsule and tablet formulations bind phosphate to a similar extent. Sevelamer treatment also results in a lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and total serum cholesterol levels. Mechanism of action: Sevelamer prevents hyperphosphatemia by binding to dietary phosphate in the gut, preventing its absorption and thus decreasing serum parathyroid hormone levels. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Phosphate Binders" .

(PubChem) Pharmacology: Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic that competitively inhibits the activation of plasminogen to plasmin. Tranexamic acid is a competitive inhibitor of plasminogen activation, and at much higher concentrations, a noncompetitive inhibitor of plasmin, i.e., actions similar to aminocaproic acid. Tranexamic acid is about 10 times more potent in vitro than aminocaproic acid. Tranexamic acid binds more strongly than aminocaproic acid to both the strong and weak receptor sites of the plasminogen molecule in a ratio corresponding to the difference in potency between the compounds. Tranexamic acid in a concentration of 1 mg per mL does not aggregate platelets in vitro. In patients with hereditary angioedema, inhibition of the formation and activity of plasmin by tranexamic acid may prevent attacks of angioedema by decreasing plasmin-induced activation of the first complement protein (C1). Mechanism of action: Tranexamic acid competitively inhibits activation of plasminogen (via binding to the kringle domain), thereby reducing conversion of plasminogen to plasmin (fibrinolysin), an enzyme that degrades fibrin clots, fibrinogen, and other plasma proteins, including the procoagulant factors V and VIII. Tranexamic acid also directly inhibits plasmin activity, but higher doses are required than are needed to reduce plasmin formation. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.

Trihexyphenidyl possesses both anticholinergic and antihistaminic effects, although only the former has been established as therapeutically significant in the management of parkinsonism. Mechanism of action: Trihexyphenidyl is a selective M1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. It is able to discriminate between the M1 (cortical or neuronal) and the peripheral muscarinic subtypes (cardiac and glandular). Trihexyphenidyl partially blocks cholinergic activity in the CNS, which is responsible for the symptoms of Parkinson's disease.

Trimeprazine is in the same class of drugs as chlorpromazine (Thorazine) and trifluoperazine (Stelazine); however, unlike the other drugs in this class, trimeprazine is not used clinically as an anti-psychotic. It acts as an anti-histamine, a sedative, and an anti-emetic (anti-nausea). Trimeprazine is used principally as an anti-emetic, to prevent motion sickness or as an anti-histamine in combination with other medications in cough and cold preparations. Tricyclic antihistamines are also structurally-related to the tricyclic antidepressants, explaining the antihistaminergic adverse effects of these two drug classes and also the poor tolerability profile of tricyclic H1-antihistamines. Mechanism of action: Trimeprazine competes with free histamine for binding at HA-receptor sites. This antagonizes the effects of histamine on HA-receptors, leading to a reduction of the negative symptoms brought on by histamine HA-receptor binding. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule.

    skos:definition "is the science of determining the arrangement of atoms within a crystal from the manner in which a beam of X-rays is scattered from the electrons within the crystal. The method produces a three-dimensional picture of the density of electrons within the crystal, from which the mean atomic positions, their chemical bonds, their disorder and sundry other information can be derived. The technique of single-crystal X-ray crystallography has three basic steps. The first, and often most difficult, step is to obtain an adequate crystal of the material under study. The crystal should be sufficiently large, pure in composition and regular in structure, with no large internal imperfections such as cracks or twinning. In the second step, the crystal is placed in an intense beam of X-rays, usually of a single wavelength (monochromatic X-rays), producing the regular pattern of reflections. As the crystal is gradually rotated, previous reflections disappear and new ones appear; the intensity of every spot is recorded meticulously at every orientation of the crystal. Multiple data sets may have to be collected, with each set covering slightly more than half a full rotation of the crystal and containing tens of thousands of reflection intensities. In the third step, these data are combined computationally with complementary chemical information to produce and refine a model of the arrangement of atoms within the crystal. The final, refined model, now called a crystal structure, is usually stored in a public database." .

It is available as a tablet and is usually dosed twice daily. Another leukotriene receptor antagonist is montelukast (Singulair), which is usually taken just once daily.Zafirlukast blocks the action of the cysteinyl leukotrienes on the CysLT1 receptors, thus reducing constriction of the airways, build-up of mucus in the lungs and inflammation of the breathing passages. Pharmacology: Zafirlukast is a synthetic, selective peptide leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) indicated for the prophylaxis and chronic treatment of asthma. Patients with asthma were found in one study to be 25-100 times more sensitive to the bronchoconstricting activity of inhaled LTD4 than nonasthmatic subjects. In vitro studies demonstrated that zafirlukast antagonized the contractile activity of three leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4) in conducting airway smooth muscle from laboratory animals and humans. Zafirlukast prevented intradermal LTD4-induced increases in cutaneous vascular permeability and inhibited inhaled LTD4-induced influx of eosinophils into animal lungs. Mechanism of action: Zafirlukast is a selective and competitive receptor antagonist of leukotriene D4 and E4 (LTD4 and LTE4), components of slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRSA). Cysteinyl leukotriene production and receptor occupation have been correlated with the pathophysiology of asthma, including airway edema, smooth muscle constriction, and altered cellular activity associated with the inflammatory process, which contribute to the signs and symptoms of asthma.

In addition to zopiclone's benzodiazepine pharmacological properties it also has some barbiturate like properties. Pharmacology: Zopiclone is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic from the pyrazolopyrimidine class and is indicated for the short-term treatment of insomnia. While Zopiclone is a hypnotic agent with a chemical structure unrelated to benzodiazepines, barbiturates, or other drugs with known hypnotic properties, it interacts with the gamma-aminobutyric acid-benzodiazepine (GABABZ) receptor complex. Subunit modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex is hypothesized to be responsible for some of the pharmacological properties of benzodiazepines, which include sedative, anxiolytic, muscle relaxant, and anticonvulsive effects in animal models. Zopiclone binds selectively to the brain alpha subunit of the GABA A omega-1 receptor. Mechanism of action: Zopiclone exerts its action by binding on the benzodiazepine receptor complex and modulation of the GABABZ receptor chloride channel macromolecular complex. Drug type: Approved.

The axial hindbrain can be easily segmented on coronal or sagittal T2-weighted MRI, as it is comprised largely of myelinated fibers, which appear as very dark well-defined areas. The rostral protrusion of the hindbrain, the interpeduncular nucleus, appears as a light ellipse just medial to the substantia nigra. The trigeminothalamic tracts and the medial lemnisci emerge as a dark triangle just lateral to the interpeduncular nucleus. Moving caudally through the pontine nuclei the border between the midbrain and hindbrain moves dorsally as a horizontal line between the ventral-most extents of the inferior colliculi, or just above the very dark medial longitudinal fasciculus. Even further caudally this border sits just ventral to the fourth ventricle. The border between the hindbrain and cerebellum is defined mostly by the borders of the fourth ventricle. The major difficulty is in deciding how to divide the cerebellar peduncles, which traverse the cerebellum/hindbrain border. One solution is to follow a best-fit line between the vestibular nuclei medially and the cochlear nuclei laterally and use that as a dividing line between cerebellum and hindbrain.

Moving caudally, the midbrain begins to emerge ventral to the diencephalon just as the substantia nigra (light on T2) comes in to view. The emerging oculomotor nerve–a dark streak on T2–is one of the best markers of the ventral midbrain. Further caudally, at roughly the caudal-most extent of the mammillary bodies, the slightly brighter superior colliculus emerges at the dorsal border of the diencephalon. Still further caudal the dorsal and ventral parts of the midbrain move closer together as the diencephalon disappears. Finally, near the caudal border of the substantia nigra all that remains of the diencephalon is a light appearing protrusion from the midbrain medially in to the hippocampus laterally (the geniculate nuclei). The dorsal border between the midbrain and hippocampus/retrosplenial cortex is clearly defined by a small thin potential space that can appear as a light or dark line depending on the presence or absence of water in the space. The ventral border with hindbrain is comparably simple. Moving caudally through the pontine nuclei the border between the midbrain and hindbrain moves dorsally as a horizontal line between the ventral-most extents of the inferior colliculi, or just above the very dark medial longitudinal fasciculus. Even further caudally this border sits just ventral to the fourth ventricle. The caudal border between the midbrain and cerebellar cortex is straightforward, as the superior colliculi appear significantly darker than the cortex of the 2nd-4th cerebellar lobules." .

Originally developed as a test of emotionality by Calvin Hall (1932). The open field is an arena with walls to prevent escape. Commonly, the field is marked with a grid, and square crossings, rearing, and time spent moving are used to assess the activity of the rodent. In the modern open field apparatus, infrared beams or video cameras with associated software can be used to automate the assessment process. The OFT is also often used to assess anxiety by including additional measures of defecation, time spent in the center of the field, and the first few minutes of activity. The relation between the OFT and other tests of exploratory activity (elevated plus maze and emergence) have been analyzed in two mouse strains. Changes in these measures are often used to assess the sedative or stimulant effects of pharmacological agents (adapted from Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Field_(animal_test%))." .

    skos:definition "A behavioral paradigm that serves as arodent model of anxiety and is also used as a screening test for putative anxiolytic or anxiogenic compounds and as a general research tool in neurobiological anxiety research. The test setting consists of a plus-shaped apparatus with two open and two enclosed arms, each with an open roof, elevated 40–70 cm from the floor. The model is based on rodents' aversion of open spaces. This aversion leads to the behavior termed thigmotaxis, which involves avoidance of open areas by confining movements to enclosed spaces or to the edges of a bounded space. In EPM this translates into a restriction of movement to the enclosed arms.Anxiety reduction in the plus-maze is indicated by an increase in the proportion of time spent in the open arms (time in open arms/total time in open or closed arms), and an increase in the proportion of entries into the open arms (entries into open arms/total entries into open or closed arms). Total number of arm entries and number of closed-arm entries are usually employed as measures of general activity. (adapted from Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevated_plus_maze)" .

It is used to treat invasive fungal infections that are generally seen in patients who are immunocompromised. These include invasive candidiasis, invasive aspergillosis, and emerging fungal infections. Pharmacology: Voriconazole is a triazole antifungal agent indicated for use in the treatment of fungal infections including invasive aspergillosis, esophageal candidiasis, and serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium apiospermum (asexual form of Pseudallescheria boydii) and Fusarium spp. including Fusarium solani. Fungal plasma membranes are similar to mammalian plasma membranes, differing in having the nonpolar sterol ergosterol, rather than cholesterol, as the principal sterol. Membrane sterols such as ergosterol provide structure, modulation of membrane fluidity, and possibly control of some physiologic events. Voriconazole effects the formation of the fungal plasma membrane by indirectly inhibiting the biosynthesis of ergosterol. This results in plasma membrane permeability changes and inhibition of growth. Mechanism of action: Voriconazole binds and inhibits ergosterol synthesis by inhibiting CYP450-dependent 14-alpha sterol demethylase. The inhibition of 14-alpha sterol demethylase results in a depletion of ergosterol in fungal cell membrane. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antifungal Agents.

Sparfloxacin exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a bacterial topoisomerase. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme which controls DNA topology and assists in DNA replication, repair, deactivation, and transcription. Pharmacology: Sparfloxacin is a synthetic fluoroquinolone broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent in the same class as ofloxacin and norfloxacin. Sparfloxacin has in vitro activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive microorganisms. Sparfloxacin exerts its antibacterial activity by inhibiting DNA gyrase, a bacterial topoisomerase. DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme which controls DNA topology and assists in DNA replication, repair, deactivation, and transcription. Quinolones differ in chemical structure and mode of action from (beta)-lactam antibiotics. Quinolones may, therefore, be active against bacteria resistant to (beta)-lactam antibiotics. Although cross-resistance has been observed between sparfloxacin and other fluoroquinolones, some microorganisms resistant to other fluoroquinolones may be susceptible to sparfloxacin. In vitro tests show that the combination of sparfloxacin and rifampin is antagonistic against Staphylococcus aureus. Mechanism of action: The bactericidal action of sparfloxacin results from inhibition of the enzymes topoisomerase II (DNA gyrase) and topoisomerase IV, which are required for bacterial DNA replication, transcription, repair, and recombination.

    skos:definition "A beta-adrenergic antagonist similar in action to propranolol. The levo-isomer is the more active. Timolol has been proposed as an antihypertensive, antiarrhythmic, antiangina, and antiglaucoma agent. It is also used in the treatment of migraine disorders and tremor. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Similar to propranolol and nadolol, timolol is a non-selective, beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist. Timolol does not have significant intrinsic sympathomimetic, direct myocardial depressant, or local anesthetic (membrane-stabilizing) activity, but does possess a relatively high degree of lipid solubility. Timolol, when applied topically to the eye, has the action of reducing elevated, as well as normal, intraocular pressure, whether or not accompanied by glaucoma. Elevated intraocular pressure is a major risk factor in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous visual field loss and optic nerve damage. Mechanism of action: Like propranolol and nadolol, timolol competes with adrenergic neurotransmitters such as catecholamines for binding at beta(1)-adrenergic receptors in the heart and vascular smooth muscle and beta(2)-receptors in the bronchial and vascular smooth muscle. Beta(1)-receptor blockade results in a decrease in resting and exercise heart rate and cardiac output, a decrease in both systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and, possibly, a reduction in reflex orthostatic hypotension. Beta(2)-blockade results in an increase in peripheral vascular resistance. The exact mechanism whereby timolol reduces ocular pressure is still not known. The most likely action is by decreasing the secretion of aqueous humor. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Adrenergic beta-Antagonists. Anti-Arrhythmia Agents. Antihypertensive Agents" .

The enzyme (38kDa) is a member of the Integrase family of site specific recombinase and it is known to catalyse the site specific recombination event between two DNA recognition sites (loxP sites).  Cre recombinase is a widely used tool in the field of molecular biology. The enzyme's unique and specific recombination system is exploited to manipulate genes and chromosomes in a huge range of research, such as gene knock out or knock in studies. The enzyme's ability to operate efficiently in a wide range of cellular environments (including mammals, plants, bacteria, and yeast) enables the Cre-Lox recombination system to be used in a vast number of organisms, making it a particularly useful tool in scientific research (Adapted from Wikipedia:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cre_recombinase)" .

    skos:definition "A taxon (plural taxa), or taxonomic unit, is a name designating an organism or group of organisms. A taxon is assigned a rank and can be placed at a particular level in a systematic hierarchy reflecting evolutionary relationships. A distinction is to be made between taxa/taxonomy and classification/systematics or the evolutionarily organized classification, cladistics. The former refers to biological names and the rules of naming, and as such, can be somewhat arbitrarily applied in regards to an organism's location in a phylogenetic classification scheme. The latter refers to rank ordering of taxa according to presumptive evolutionary (phylogenetic) relationships inferred based on organism characteristics such as adult or developmental morphology, DNA sequence, enzymatic pathways, ecosystem relations to other organisms, etc.. A prefix is used to indicate a ranking of lesser importance. The prefix super- indicates a rank above, the prefix sub- indicates a rank below. In zoology the prefix infra- indicates a rank below sub-. Note that rank is relative, and restricted to a particular systematic schema. For example, liverworts have been grouped, in various systems of classification, as a family, order, or a class. The use of a narrow set of ranks is challenged by users of cladistics; for example, the mere 10 ranks traditionally used between animal families (governed by the ICZN) and animal phyla (usually the highest relevant rank in taxonomic work) often cannot adequately represent the evolutionary history as more about a lineage's phylogeny becomes known. In addition, the class rank is quite often not an evolutionary but a phenetical and paraphyletic group and as opposed to those ranks governed by the ICZN, can usually not be made monophyletic by exchanging the taxa contained therein. This has given rise to phylogenetic taxonomy and the ongoing development of the PhyloCode, which is to govern the application of taxa to clades.@en" .

    skos:definition "The Type II ganglion cells, like the piriform cells, have all or almost all of their dendritic field superficial to the cell body. The 15 to 25 micrometers cell body lies within a narrow range of depths at the deep margin of the zone of vertical cells from which it may send 3 to 7 primary dendrites vertically or obliquely towards the surface to form a dendritic field in excess of 400 micrometers in diameter and about 500 micrometers deep. The primary dendrites may derive from any portion of the cell body surface, but they usually arise from the dorsal or lateral surfaces. The dendrites of Type II ganglion cells intermingle, giving them a dense arbor of dendrites that extend over large regions of the superior colliculus. The axon may originate from the cell body or a low order dendrite. It may project into the region superficial to the cell body (figs. 9, 14) or into the deep zones (fig. 15). The axon of the superficial projection is similar to other intrinsic axons except for being thicker. It branches frequently to form an arbor approximately as wide as the dendritic field, which it overlaps, but they are not necessarily coincident, nor is one contained within the other." .

As defined here, tegmentum refers to the whole of the midbrain (Baer, 1837) excluding the tectum but including the pretectal region (Scalia, 1972); see Swanson (2000, pp. 522, 526). Usage of this term is very complex, inconsistent, and illogical; see for example Crosby et al. (1962, pp. 221, 260, 262), Carpenter (1976, p. 367 ff.)." .

    skos:definition "An ibuprofen-type anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic. It inhibits prostaglandin synthesis and has been proposed as an anti-arthritic. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Suprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesic and antipyretic. Ophthalmic anti-inflammatory medicines are used in the eye to lessen problems that can occur during or after some kinds of eye surgery. Sometimes, the pupil of the eye gets smaller during an operation (pupil constriction), making it more difficult for the surgeon to reach some areas of the eye. Suprofen is used to help prevent this. Mechanism of action: Suprofen binds to the cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) isoenzymes, preventing the synthesis of prostaglandins and reducing the inflammatory response. Cyclooxygenase catalyses the formation of prostaglandins and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A2). Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger molecules in the process of inflammation. The overall result is a reduction in pain and inflammation in the eyes and the prevention of pupil constriction during surgery. Normally trauma to the anterior segment of the eye (especially the iris) increases endogenous prostaglandin synthesis which leads to constriction of the iris sphincter. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal. Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors" .

(PubChem) Pharmacology: Tubocurarine, a naturally occurring alkaloid, is used to treat smoking withdrawl syndrom. Mechanism of action: Tubocurarine, the chief alkaloid in tobacco products, binds stereo-selectively to nicotinic-cholinergic receptors at the autonomic ganglia, in the adrenal medulla, at neuromuscular junctions, and in the brain. Two types of central nervous system effects are believed to be the basis of Tubocurarine's positively reinforcing properties. A stimulating effect is exerted mainly in the cortex via the locus ceruleus and a reward effect is exerted in the limbic system. At low doses the stimulant effects predominate while at high doses the reward effects predominate. Intermittent intravenous administration of Tubocurarine activates neurohormonal pathways, releasing acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, vasopressin, beta-endorphin, growth hormone, and ACTH.

The entire dorsal and lateral border is defined by the corpus callosum/external capsule/deep cerebral white matter complex, which is much darker (higher diffusivity) on DWI. Rostrally, the striatum emerges from the center of darker forceps minor of the corpus callosum as a light, speckled patch. The ventral border between the caudate/putamen and the accumbens can be identified based on the end of the dark striations that define the caudate/putamen. Further caudal, the ventral border between the amygdala and striatum is similarly easy to identify based on the end of the dark striations. The medial border with the pallidum is subtle and may be indistinguishable on T2 MRI. On DWI, the pallidum is somewhat darker than the caudate/putamen and is more densely striated. By narrowing the contrast window, this difference can be accentuated enough to make the border apparent. At its caudal extent, the striatum is a small triangular region bounded laterally by the darker external capsule, medially by the darker internal capsule and fimbria, and ventrally by the much brighter and non-striated amygdala." .

    skos:definition "Troglitazone was withdrawn in 2000 due to risk of hepatotoxicity. It was superseded by pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. Pharmacology: Troglitazone is an oral antihyperglycemic agent which acts primarily by decreasing insulin resistance. Troglitazone is used in the management of type II diabetes (noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) also known as adult-onset diabetes). It improves sensitivity to insulin in muscle and adipose tissue and inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis. Troglitazone is not chemically or functionally related to either the sulfonylureas, the biguanides, or the g-glucosidase inhibitors. Troglitazone may be used concomitantly with a sulfonylurea or insulin to improve glycemic control. Mechanism of action: Troglitazone is a thiazolidinedione antidiabetic agent that lowers blood glucose by improving target cell response to insulin. It has a unique mechanism of action that is dependent on the presence of insulin for activity. Troglitazone decreases hepatic glucose output and increases insulindependent glucose disposal in skeletal muscle. Its mechanism of action is thought to involve binding to nuclear receptors (PPAR) that regulate the transcription of a number of insulin responsive genes critical for the control of glucose and lipid metabolism. Unlike sulfonylureas, troglitazone is not an insulin secretagogue. Drug type: Small Molecule. Withdrawn. Drug category: Antineoplastic Agents. Fibrinolytic Agents. Hypoglycemic Agents. Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors. Vasodilator Agents" .

Zometa is used to prevent skeletal fractures in patients with cancers such as multiple myeloma and prostate cancer. It can also be used to treat hypercalcemia of malignancy and can be helpful for treating pain from bone metastases.An annual dose of Zoledronate may also prevent recurring fractures in patients with a previous hip fracture.Zoledronate is a single 5 mg infusion for the treatment of Paget's disease of bone. In 2007, the FDA also approved Reclast for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Pharmacology: Zoledronate is a bisphosphonic acid which is an inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption. Zoledronate is used to prevent osteoporosis and skeletal fractures, particularly in patients with cancers such as multiple myeloma and prostate cancer. It can also be used to treat hypercalcemia, particularly hypercalcemia of malignancy. It can also be helpful for treating pain from bone metastases. Mechanism of action: The action of zoledronate on bone tissue is based partly on its affinity for hydroxyapatite, which is part of the mineral matrix of bone. Zoledronate also targets farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) synthase. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates such as zoledronate appear to act as analogues of isoprenoid diphosphate lipids, thereby inhibiting FPP synthase, an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Inhibition of this enzyme in osteoclasts prevents the biosynthesis of isoprenoid lipids (FPP and GGPP) that are essential for the post-translational farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPase signalling proteins. This activity inhibits osteoclast activity and reduces bone resorption and turnover. In postmenopausal women, it reduces the elevated rate of bone turnover, leading to, on average, a net gain in bone mass. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antihypocalcemic Agents. Antiresorptives. Bisphosphonates. Bone Density Conservation Agents" .

(PubChem) Pharmacology: Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic. The sulfonamides are synthetic bacteriostatic antibiotics with a wide spectrum against most gram-positive and many gram-negative organisms. However, many strains of an individual species may be resistant. Sulfonamides inhibit multiplication of bacteria by acting as competitive inhibitors of p-aminobenzoic acid in the folic acid metabolism cycle. Bacterial sensitivity is the same for the various sulfonamides, and resistance to one sulfonamide indicates resistance to all. Most sulfonamides are readily absorbed orally. However, parenteral administration is difficult, since the soluble sulfonamide salts are highly alkaline and irritating to the tissues. The sulfonamides are widely distributed throughout all tissues. High levels are achieved in pleural, peritoneal, synovial, and ocular fluids. Although these drugs are no longer used to treat meningitis, CSF levels are high in meningeal infections. Their antibacterial action is inhibited by pus. Mechanism of action: Sulfacetamide is a competitive inhibitor of bacterial para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), an essential component for bacterial growth (according to the Woods-Fildes theory). The inhibited reaction is necessary in these organisms for the synthesis of folic acid. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anti-Bacterial Agents. Anti-Infective Agents, Local.

The improvement in resolution is achieved by using two opposing objective lenses both of which focused to the same geometrical location. Also the difference in optical path length through each of the two objective lenses is carefully aligned to be minimal. By this, molecules residing in the common focal area of both objectives can be illuminated coherently from both sides and also the reflected or emitted light can be collected coherently, i.e. coherent superposition of emitted light on the detector is possible.

It is an analog of GABA, but it is not a receptor agonist. Mechanism of action: It is believed that vigabatrin increases brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the CNS, by irreversibly inhibiting enzymes that catabolize GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase GABA-T) or block the reuptake of GABA into glia and nerve endings. Vigabatrin may also work by suppressing repetitive neuronal firing through inhibition of voltage-sensitive sodium channels. Drug type: Approved. Small Molecule. Drug category: Anticonvulsants.

Transgenic mice exhibit a progressive neurological phenotype that mimics many of the features of HD, including choreiform-like movements, involuntary stereotypic movements, tremor, and epileptic seizures, as well as nonmovement disorder components, including unusual vocalization. They urinate frequently and exhibit loss of body weight and muscle bulk through the course of the disease. Neurologically they develop Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusions (NII) which contain both the huntingtin and ubiquitin proteins. Previously unknown, these NII have subsequently been identified in human HD patients. The age of onset of HD symptoms is reported to occur between 9 and 11 weeks. Commonly known as the \"R6/2\" strain.Transgenic mice develop hyperglycemia by 12 weeks of age with a corresponding decrease in insulin levels. Pancreatic beta cells develop huntingtin inclusions as early as 7 weeks of age, by 12 weeks more than 95% of beta cells have inclusions. Pancreatic alpha and delta cells also exhibit some inclusions (24% and 6% of cells, respectively) by 12 weeks. Pancreatic islets become hypotonic and beta cells are dramatically reduced in number by 12 weeks. Beta cells contain very few insulin secretory vesicles. (Bjorkquvist M., et al. 2005)DevelopmentThe transgene is about 1 kb of the human HD gene and includes the promoter region, exon 1 with 120 +/- 5 CAG repeats. This strain was identified as the R6-2 line in the original publication.In fall 2006, the B6CBA-Tg(HDexon1)62Gpb/1J colony was shown to have a reduction in the number of CAG repeat units in the transgene (approximately 100-105 CAG repeats), and to exhibit a concomitant decrease in severity and delayed onset in the expected neurological phenotype. The Repository recovered frozen embryos from the HDexon1 line during the winter of 2006/7. The cryo-recovered line has approximately 160 +/- 10 CAG repeats, and onset of HD symptoms occurs between 9 and 11 weeks of age, as originally reported for this strain.The cryo-recovered line will be named B6CBA-Tg(HDexon1)62Gpb/1J (Stock No. 002810). The line formerly distributed as Stock No. 002810 will be named B6CBA-Tg(HDexon1)62Gpb/3J (Stock No. 006494)." .

As originally described by Woolsey and Van der Loos,  this ring represents the side of the barrel and surrounds an area of lower cell density which they named the hollow. Each barrel is separated from its  neighbors by a clear, nearly acellular area  termed  the septum. In tangentially  oriented sections, a septum can be seen to separate a barrel from its neighbors." .

The H-reflex test is performed using an electric stimulator, which gives usually a square-wave current of short duration and small amplitude (higher stimulations might involve alpha fibers, causing a M-wave, compromising the results), and an EMG set, to record the muscle response. That response is usually a clear wave, called H-wave, 50 ms after the stimulus, not to be confused with M-wave at 25-30 ms, which might appear in too intense stimulations.

Hyperkinesis begins at 3 months of age with progressive motor impairment appearing at 6 months of age. This is followed by progressive neurodegeneration, starting at 9 months of age, and hypokinesis at 12 months. The motor dysfunction, Rotorod deficit, is correlated with neuronal loss. Mutants exhibit decreased brain weight and reduced striatal and cortical volumes. 18% shrinkage of striatal neurons is observed in 12 month old mutants. A significant decrease (15%) in the number of striatal neurons occurs by 12 months of age. Nuclear huntingtin aggregate inclusions of striatal neurons from 18 month old mutant mice are detected at the light microscopy level. This mutant mouse strain represents a model that may be useful in studies of Huntington's disease.DevelopmentA YAC containing a full-length human huntingtin gene was modified with a 128 CAG repeat expansion in exon 1.

NGF is critical for the survival and maintenance of sympathetic and sensory neurons. NGF is released from the target cells, binds to and activates its high affinity receptor TrkA, and is internalized into the responsive neuron. The NGF/TrkA complex is subsequently trafficked back to the cell body. This movement of NGF from axon tip to soma is thought to be involved in the long-distance signaling of neurons" .

NT-3 was the third neurotrophic factor to be characterized, after NGF and BDNF.Although the vast majority of neurons in the mammalian brain are formed prenatally, parts of the adult brain retain the ability to grow new neurons from neural stem cells; a process known as neurogenesis. Neurotrophins are chemicals that help to stimulate and control neurogenesis. NT-3 is unique in the number of neurons it can potentially stimulate, given its ability to activate two of the receptor tyrosine kinase neurotrophin receptors (TrkC and TrkB - see below). Mice born without the ability to make NT-3 have loss of proprioceptive and subsets of mechanoreceptive sensory neurons." .

This paradigm is commonly used in animal studies to evaluate preferences for environmental stimuli that have been associated with a positive or negative reward.

The name is something of a relic though (the term was coined by Dr. Paetkau, University of Victoria); it has since been found that interleukins are produced by a wide variety of body cells. The function of the immune system depends in a large part on interleukins, and rare deficiencies of a number of them have been described, all featuring autoimmune diseases or immune deficiency.

Mice homozygous for this SMNF7 floxed allele are viable and fertile and do not display any gross physical or behavioral abnormalities. Mutant mice exhibit no transcript splicing defects. Cre-mediated recombination of the loxP-flanked sequences results in deletion of exon 7 of the targeted gene. As mutations of this exon are implicated in 95% of all human spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), these mice may be useful in studying SMA or other neuromuscular degenerative diseases.When crossed to a strain expressing Cre recombinase in neurons (see Stock No. 005938, Stock No. 006297, and Stock No. 006663), this mutant mouse strain may be useful as a model of SMA.When crossed to a strain expressing Cre recombinase in striated muscle fibers (see Stock No. 005936, Stock No. 006139, and Stock No. 006149), this mutant mouse strain may be useful as a model of SMA.SMNF7 mice are available on different genetic backgrounds (see Stock No. 006138 and Stock No. 006146). In an attempt to offer alleles on well-characterized or multiple genetic backgrounds, alleles are frequently moved to a genetic background different from that on which an allele was first characterized. It should be noted that the SMNF7 phenotype could vary from that originally described on a mixed genetic background. We will modify the strain description if necessary as published results become available.Importation of this model was supported by the Spinal Muscular Atrophy Foundation. Creation and development was supported by the National Institute of Health and Medical Research of France (Inserm) and the Association Française contre les Myopathies (AFM). An additional help was provided by Families of SMA (U.S.A.) and Andrew?s Buddies (U.S.A.).DevelopmentA targeting vector was used to insert a neomycin resistance gene within intron 6 and place loxP sites immediately flanking exon 7 of the endogenous gene. This construct was electroporated into \"129Sv\" embryonic stem (ES) cells. Correctly targeted cells were injected into blastocysts. The resulting chimeric males were bred to C57BL/6J females. Heterozygous offspring were bred to generate homozygous mice. Homozygotes on this mixed B6;129 background were bred together for approximately 5 years before arrival at The Jackson Laboratory. After arriving, mutant mice were backcrossed to C57BL/6J inbred mice (Stock No. 000664) for 5-10 generations. After this, heterozygotes were bred together to generate this homozygous congenic colony.

Onset of the disease is usually between the ages of 20 and 40, although it has been diagnosed in men from their teens to their 70s. Early symptoms include tremor of the outstretched hands, muscle cramps with exertion, and fasciculations (fleeting muscle twitches visible under the skin). Eventually, individuals develop limb weakness which usually begins in the pelvic or shoulder regions. Weakness of the facial and tongue muscles may occur later in the course of the disease and often leads to dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing), dysarthria (slurring of speech), and recurrent aspiration pneumonia. Some individuals develop gynecomastia (excessive enlargement of male breasts) and low sperm count or infertility. Still others develop non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.  Kennedy's disease is an x-linked recessive disease, which means the patient's mother carries the defective gene on one of her X chromosomes. Daughters of patients with Kennedy's disease are also carriers and have a 1 in 2 chance of having a son affected with the disease. Parents with concerns about their children may wish to talk to a genetic counselor. (http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/kennedys/kennedys.htm)" .

It is a form of dystonia, a movement disorder in which muscle contractions cause sustained eyelid closure, twitching or repetitive movements. BEB begins gradually with increased frequency of eye blinking often associated with eye irritation. Other symptoms may include involuntary winking or squinting of one or both eyes, increasing difficulty in keeping the eyes open, and light sensitivity. Generally, the spasms occur during the day, disappear in sleep, and reappear after waking. As the condition progresses, the spasms may intensify, forcing the eyelids to remain closed for long periods of time, and thereby causing substantial visual disturbance or functional blindness. It is important to note that the blindness is caused solely by the uncontrollable closing of the eyelids and not by a dysfunction of the eyes. BEB occurs in both men and women, although it is especially common in middle-aged and elderly women. (NINDS Disorder Index, http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/blepharospasm/blepharospasm.htm)" .

It is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, and is also one of two medications in the United States with an FDA-approved indication for the treatment of restless legs syndrome (the other being Pramipexole). (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Ropinirole is a nonergot dopamine agonist with high relative in vitro specificity and full intrinsic activity at the D2 subfamily of dopamine receptors, binding with higher affinity to D3 than to D2 or D4 receptor subtypes. The relevance of D3 receptor binding in Parkinson's disease is unknown. The mechanism of ropinirole-induced postural hypotension is presumed to be due to a D2 -mediated blunting of the noradrenergic response to standing and subsequent decrease in peripheral vascular resistance. Mechanism of action: Ropinirole binds the dopamine receptors D3 and D2. Although the precise mechanism of action of ropinirole as a treatment for Parkinson's disease is unknown, it is believed to be related to its ability to stimulate these receptors in the striatum. This conclusion is supported by electrophysiologic studies in animals that have demonstrated that ropinirole influences striatal neuronal firing rates via activation of dopamine receptors in the striatum and the substantia nigra, the site of neurons that send projections to the striatum.

Its primary competitors on the market are tadalafil (Cialis), and vardenafil (Levitra). (Wikipedia) Pharmacology: Sildenafil is used to treat male erectile dysfunction (impotence) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Part of the physiological process of erection involves the release of nitric oxide (NO) in the corpus cavernosum. This then activates the enzyme guanylate cyclase which results in increased levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), leading to smooth muscle relaxation in the corpus cavernosum, resulting in increased inflow of blood and an erection. Sildenafil is a potent and selective inhibitor of cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum. This means that, with Sildenafil on board, normal sexual stimulation leads to increased levels of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum which leads to better erections. Without sexual stimulation and no activation of the NO/cGMP system, Sildenafil should not cause an erection. Mechanism of action: Sildenafil inhibits the cGMP specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) which is responsible for degradation of cGMP in the corpus cavernosum located around the penis. Penile erection during sexual stimulation is caused by increased penile blood flow resulting from the relaxation of penile arteries and corpus cavernosal smooth muscle. This response is mediated by the release of nitric oxide (NO) from nerve terminals and endothelial cells, which stimulates the synthesis of cGMP in smooth muscle cells. Cyclic GMP causes smooth muscle relaxation and increased blood flow into the corpus cavernosum. The inhibition of phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) by Sildenafil enhances erectile function by increasing the amount of cGMP. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors. Vasodilator Agents" .

It may slow progression of the clinical disease and delay the requirement for levodopa therapy. It also may be given with levodopa upon onset of disability. (From AMA Drug Evaluations Annual, 1994, p385) The compound without isomeric designation is Deprenyl. (PubChem) Pharmacology: Dopamine is an essential chemical that occurs in many parts of the body. It is the premature degradation of dopamine that results in the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) is an enzyme which accelerates the breakdown of dopamine. Selegiline can prolong the effects of dopamine in the brain by preventing its breakdown through seletively blocking MAO. It also may prevent the removal of dopamine between nerve endings and enhance release of dopamine from nerve cells. Mechanism of action: Although the mechanisms for selegiline's beneficial action in the treatment of Parkinson's disease are not fully understood, the inhibition of monoamine oxidase type B (MAO B) is thought to be of primary importance. MAO B is involved in the oxidative deamination of dopamine in the brain. Selegiline is best known as an irreversible inhibitor of MAO. MAO's activity is inhibited when selegiline binds to the isoalloxazine flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) at its active center. In addition, there is evidence that selegiline may increase dopaminergic activity through other mechanisms. Drug type: Approved. Investigational. Small Molecule. Drug category: Antidyskinetics.

Usage: Interaction is a highly abstract class and in almost all cases it is more appropriate to use subclasses of interaction. It is partially possible to define generic reactions by using generic participants. A more comprehensive method is planned for BioPAX L4 for covering all generic cases like oxidization of a generic alcohol. Synonyms: Process, relationship, event.
